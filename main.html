            Flowers are the reproductive structures of flowering plants (angiosperms). 
            They come in a breathtaking variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, serving 
            not only to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies but also to 
            brighten the natural landscape. From the delicate cherry blossom to the 
            robust sunflower, flowers are a symbol of growth and beauty across the globe.
